### Remarks Checklist Options

The following pre-operative requirements can be flagged during booking:

- ☑️ **Crossmatch Blood** - Blood typing and cross-matching required
- ☑️ **Use Diathermy** - Electrosurgical unit needed
- ☑️ **Need Tourniquet** - Limb tourniquet required
- ☑️ **Need Dermatome** - Skin grafting equipment
- ☑️ **Need Montrel Mattress** - Specialized positioning
- ☑️ **Need Stirrup** - Lithotomy positioning equipment
- ☑️ **Need Armored ETT** - Reinforced endotracheal tube

**Purpose**: Ensures theatre staff prepare necessary equipment and resources before surgery.

---

### Validation Rules

The booking form enforces the following validation to ensure completeness:

#### Core Validation (Standard)
- ✅ Patient must be selected
- ✅ Procedure name required
- ✅ At least one surgeon in team (primary surgeon)

#### Enhanced Validation (Safety Protocol)
- ✅ **At least ONE of the following must be satisfied:**
  - **Option A**: At least 1 remark selected from checklist, OR
  - **Option B**: At least 2 surgeons in the team

**Rationale**: Complex procedures requiring multiple surgeons typically have higher resource needs. Solo surgeon procedures should explicitly flag equipment requirements via remarks.

#### Validation Messages
- ❌ **"Patient, procedure and a primary surgeon are required."** - Missing core fields
- ⚠️ **"Add a remark or at least two surgeons."** - Enhanced validation not met

### Best Practices

#### For Solo Surgeon Procedures
- ✅ Always select at least 1 remark
- ✅ Specify equipment needs clearly
- ✅ Indicate special positioning requirements

#### For Multi-Surgeon Procedures
- ✅ Add all team members before submitting
- ✅ Verify primary surgeon is correct
- ✅ Add remarks for complex equipment needs
- ✅ Coordinate with team members before booking

#### General Guidelines
- 📋 Review patient details carefully before submitting
- 🕐 Book surgeries as early as possible for planning
- 📝 Use clear, specific procedure names
- 🔍 Double-check indication and ward information
- 👥 Ensure all surgeons are aware of their assignment

---

### Troubleshooting

**Problem**: "Unable to select patient"
- **Solution**: Ensure patients are registered in the system. Use `/add-test-patients.html` for test data or check "manual entry" mode.

**Problem**: "Submit button disabled"
- **Solution**: Check validation messages:
  - Ensure patient, procedure, and surgeon are filled
  - Add at least 1 remark OR 2+ surgeons

**Problem**: "Patient demographics not auto-populating"
- **Solution**: Verify patient has complete profile (DOB, gender, ward). Use manual entry as fallback.

**Problem**: "Cannot remove primary surgeon"
- **Solution**: The primary surgeon (first added) can be removed. A new primary will be auto-assigned to the next surgeon in the list.

---

### Database Schema

The surgery booking creates a record in `surgery_bookings` table with:

```typescript
interface SurgeryBooking {
  id: string;
  date: Date;
  patient_id: string;
  patient_name: string;
  hospital_number?: string;        // PT-Number
  patient_age?: number;            // Calculated age
  patient_gender?: string;         // Sex
  indication?: string;             // Surgical indication
  ward?: string;                   // Patient ward
  procedure_name: string;
  anaesthesia_type: 'general' | 'regional' | 'local' | 'sedation';
  remarks?: string[];              // Array of selected remarks
  surgeon_team?: string[];         // Array of surgeon names
  primary_surgeon: string;
  // ... additional fields
}
```

**Note**: New fields (`hospital_number`, `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, `indication`, `ward`, `remarks`, `surgeon_team`) are optional to maintain backward compatibility.
