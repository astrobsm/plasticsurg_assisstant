Regional anesthesia (e.g., wrist block) provides better conditions than local infiltration for adequate exploration and tendon repair. Primary repair should be performed within 6-12 hours of injury when possible. The patient's diabetic status increases infection risk, making proper debridement crucial.",

Evidence shows that optimizing these factors pre-operatively reduces complications by 40-60%.

   - Rushing to diagnosis without complete assessment
   - Overlooking patient-specific factors (comorbidities, allergies)
   - Failing to consider alternative diagnoses
   - Not seeking senior input when uncertain

4. **When to Seek Help:**
   - Any time you're unsure about management
   - Complex cases with multiple comorbidities
   - Unexpected patient responses to treatment
   - Medicolegal concerns
